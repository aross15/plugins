# description: data for testing correlation matrix routine including correlation of missingness
# attribute -- name: attrX, description: some X values centered on zero, type: numeric, unit: units_of_X, precision: 2, editable: true
# attribute -- name: copyX, description: a copy of X to get correlation coefficient with X of +1 exactly, type: numeric, unit: units_of_X, editable: true
# attribute -- name: negX, description: -1* X to get correlation coefficient with X of -1 exactly, type: numeric, unit: units_of_X, editable: true
# attribute -- name: Only_Integer_X, description: X value if X is integer&comma; otherwise missing. Hoping for -1 correlation of missingness with Only_Fractional_X, type: numeric, unit: units_of_X, editable: true
# attribute -- name: Only_Fractional_X, description: X value if X is fractional (noninteger)&comma; otherwise missing. Hoping for -1 correlation of missingness with Only_Integer_X, type: numeric, unit: units_of_X, editable: true
# attribute -- name: Is_NonNegative_X, description: yes_NonNegative or blank, type: categorical, unit: No_Units, editable: true
# attribute -- name: Is_Integer_X, description: yes_Integer or blank. Hoping for +1 correlation of missingness with Only_Integer_X&comma; and -1 correlation of missingness with Only_Fractional_X, type: categorical, unit: No_Units, editable: true
# attribute -- name: sqrtX_or_blank, description: square root of X; provides a nontrivial correlation coefficient with X&comma; and +1 correlation of missingness with Is_NonNegative, type: numeric, unit: Units_of_sqrtX, editable: true
# attribute -- name: sqrtX_or_NaN, description: if X is negative&comma; give NaN rather than blank, type: numeric, unit: Units_of_sqrtX, editable: true, formula: sqrt(attrX)
# attribute -- name: squareX, description: the square of X; provides zero correlation with X since X is symmetric across zero, type: numeric, unit: units_of_Xsquared, editable: true
# attribute -- name: cuberootX, description: cube root of X. Provides nontrivial correlation with X whether X is NonNegative or negative., type: numeric, unit: Units_of_CubeRootX, editable: true
# attribute -- name: constant12345, description: Just the arbitrarily chosen number 12345 regardless of X. Provides a NaN correlation with X., type: numeric, unit: units_dont_matter_here, editable: true
# attribute -- name: X_E_20, description: X times 1e20 or 10^20; provides +1 correlation with X unless there are roundoff problems&comma; which seem likely. Chose 1e20 since some calculations might use Avogadro's Number 6.022e23 but 1e20 is a nicer number. Single precision floating point max is about 1e38., type: numeric, unit: Units_of_X, editable: true
# attribute -- name: X_E_100, description: X times 1e100 or 10^100; provides +1 correlation with X unless there are roundoff problems&comma; which seem likely. Chose 1e100 since it's above single float max but below double float max which is about 1e308, type: numeric, unit: Units_of_X, editable: true
